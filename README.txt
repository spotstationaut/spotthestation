Description:
We developed an app that lets you follow the ISS's real time position on a map. Furthermore, you can take pictures of it and share it either on Twitter or on our server (developed for this purpose). This server also sends push notifications to users so they know when to start their app and view the ISS. We also included an augmented reality camera that lets the user find the space station via a compass. It also overlays information about the upcoming ISS viewing (date, time and duration).

Notes:
Please change the CUSTOM_KEYS in the following classes:

"MapActivity.java"
"TwitterActivity.java"

and also in the file:
"AndroidManifest.xml"
